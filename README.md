Constellation
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valeriansaliou/constellation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valeriansaliou/constellation)

**Pluggable authoritative DNS server. Entries can be added & removed from an HTTP REST API.**

Constellation is a small authoritative server that lets you manage DNS entries from an HTTP REST API, in a generic way. It can be plugged to your existing infrastructure to manage DNS records for users of your service, eg. to configure outbound email records that cannot be easily wildcarded in a traditional DNS server (DKIM, DMARC, SPF records).

DNS entries are stored in Redis. The DNS database can thus be easily modified and dumped for backup purposes.

## Features

### Current features

* **Pluggable authoritative DNS server**, comes handy if you need to generate eg. email sub-domains for your users (with DKIM, DMARC and SPF records).
* **HTTP REST API** to check, read, insert, modify and delete DNS records on the fly.
* **Persistence layer** in Redis. This means you can run multiple Constellations hitting against the same database on the network. You can even shard Redis if you need fault tolerance on the DNS data store.

### Planned features

* **DNSSEC support**.
* **Geo-DNS routing support**, enabling Constellation to act as a geographic load balancer.

## How to use it?

### Installation

Constellation is built in Rust. To install it, either download a version from the [Constellation releases](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/constellation/releases) page, use `cargo install` or pull the source code from `master`.

**Install from source:**

If you pulled the source code from Git, you can build it using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You can find the built binaries in the `./target/release` directory.

**Install from Cargo:**

You can install Constellation directly with `cargo install`:

```bash
cargo install constellation-server
```

Ensure that your `$PATH` is properly configured to source the Crates binaries, and then run Constellation using the `constellation` command.

### Configuration

Use the sample [config.cfg](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/constellation/blob/master/config.cfg) configuration file and adjust it to your own environment.

**Available configuration options are commented below, with allowed values:**

**[server]**

* `log_level` (type: _string_, allowed: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, default: `warn`) â€” Verbosity of logging, set it to `error` in production

**[dns]**

* `inet` (type: _string_, allowed: IPv4 / IPv6 + port, default: `[::1]:53`) â€” Host and TCP port the DNS server should listen on

**[http]**

* `inet` (type: _string_, allowed: IPv4 / IPv6 + port, default: `[::1]:8080`) â€” Host and TCP port the HTTP API server should listen on
* `workers` (type: _integer_, allowed: any number, default: `2`) â€” Number of workers for the HTTP API server to run on
* `record_token` (type: _string_, allowed: secret token, default: no default) â€” Record secret token for management API access (ie. secret password)

**[redis]**

* `host` (type: _string_, allowed: hostname, IPv4, IPv6, default: `localhost`) â€” Target Redis host
* `port` (type: _integer_, allowed: TCP port, default: `6379`) â€” Target Redis TCP port
* `password` (type: _string_, allowed: password values, default: none) â€” Redis password (if no password, dont set this key)
* `database` (type: _integer_, allowed: `0` to `255`, default: `0`) â€” Target Redis database
* `pool_size` (type: _integer_, allowed: `0` to `(2^32)-1`, default: `8`) â€” Redis connection pool size
* `max_lifetime_seconds` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `20`) â€” Maximum lifetime of a connection to Redis (you want it below 5 minutes, as this affects the reconnect delay to Redis if a connection breaks)
* `idle_timeout_seconds` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `600`) â€” Timeout of idle/dead pool connections to Redis
* `connection_timeout_seconds` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `5`) â€” Timeout in seconds to consider Redis dead and reject DNS and HTTP API queries

### Run Constellation

Constellation can be run as such:

`./constellation -c /path/to/config.cfg`

## :fire: Report A Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Constellation, you are more than welcome to report it directly to [@valeriansaliou](https://github.com/valeriansaliou) by sending an encrypted email to [valerian@valeriansaliou.name](mailto:valerian@valeriansaliou.name). Do not report vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues, as they may be exploited by malicious people to target production servers running an unpatched Constellation instance.

**:warning: You must encrypt your email using [@valeriansaliou](https://github.com/valeriansaliou) GPG public key: [:key:valeriansaliou.gpg.pub.asc](https://valeriansaliou.name/files/keys/valeriansaliou.gpg.pub.asc).**

**:gift: Based on the severity of the vulnerability, I may offer a $200 (US) bounty to whomever reported it.**
