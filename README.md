**Pluggable authoritative DNS server. Entries can be added & removed from an HTTP REST API.**

Constellation is a small authoritative server that lets you manage DNS entries from an HTTP REST API, in a generic way. It can be plugged to your existing infrastructure to manage DNS records for users of your service, eg. to configure outbound email records that cannot be easily wildcarded in a traditional DNS server (DKIM, DMARC, SPF records).
